                            <br> On Tuesday, May 8th, President Donald Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement and re-impose sanctions on Tehran. The decision was met with some disappointment among the European allies partnered with the Iran Deal, fearing the possibility of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.
                            <br>
                            <br> President Trump fulfilled his campaigned promise on Iran’s nuclear deal believing that the whole structure was “decaying and rotten.” Trump, in his speech at the White House stated, “The 2015 agreement does not block Iran from developing nuclear weapons, the Iran deal is defective at its core.”
                            <br>
                            <br> The President’s announcement was met by harsh reaction from Tehran. Immediately after the announcement, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke on state television, “I have ordered Iran’s atomic organization that whenever it is needed, we will start enriching uranium more than before.”

                        <p class="sub">
                            <br> Frankly, I believe that our President made the right decision in pulling out of the Iran Deal.
                            <br>
                            <br> We need to know how the Islamic regime of the Ayatollahs operates when dealing with them. The Islamic regime is known among the Iranian population for their corruption, lies, and deceit. They will not cut a deal with anyone unless they themselves benefit in the end. There must be shrewdness and wisdom when cutting a deal with the regime in Tehran. As Senator Inhofe puts it, “We need concrete changes that would include anytime, anywhere inspections of non-declared sites, dismantling the development of advanced centrifuges, remove all sunset provisions, address Iran’s ballistic missile program and halt actions that create regional instability.”
                            <br>
                            <br> The purpose of Tehran’s development of their nuclear program, advanced ballistic missile program, and their military might in the region is to become, first and foremost, a dominant power in the Middle East. Then, it is to take over the leadership of Islamic communities around the world. An Iran with a nuclear bomb will dominate Saudi Arabia and the entire Sunni-Arab world. This is extremely dangerous. And the only way to stop Iran from developing the bomb is to have a President like Trump.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                        <div style="width:100%;text-align:center;padding-bottom:10px;padding-top:5px;">
                            <span style="font-family:georgia, serif; font-size:12px; font-style:italic;">Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani</span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        </div>

                        <p class="sub">

                            The imposed economic sanctions on Iran were working. The regime of the hardliners were on the brink of collapse, before President Obama came to their rescue by lifting the imposed sanction and aiding them with $150 Billion.
                            <br>
                            <br> With President Trump’s withdrawal, existing sanctions will be tightened, and new sanctions will be imposed - essentially isolating Iran from the outside world. Iran’s economy is in shambles, with inflation as high as 12%, and unemployment above 25%.
                            <br>
                            <br> The Iranian society is a broken in every level: socially, economically, and spiritually. This move by President Trump may be a chance to bankrupt the current Islamic regime and end almost 4 decades of Islamic dictatorship and allow the Iranian people to have a chance at freedom.
                            <br>
                            <br> Let’s keep the people of Iran in prayer. They have been subject to a harsh dictatorship for far too long. Let’s pray for their chance at freedom!
