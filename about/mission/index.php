                            <br>Today, in a just minutes, we can broadcast live into the homes of millions of people who have never heard the name of "Jesus". Unsuspecting Muslims flipping through their TV channels happen across our TV broadcast and come to know the saving power of Jesus Christ and renounce their faith in the god of the Qu'uran.
                            <br>
                            <br> We do this by satellite TV - the most effective way of ministering to Muslims living in Farsi-speaking nations.</p>

                        <p class="sub">Before satellite TV (brought to Iran in the early 2000s), ministering to Muslims was a daring, near-impossible task. It required moving to a foreign nation, planting families, facing possible imprisonment - or even death - just to minister at a one-on-one level.
                            <br>
                            <br>But not today.
                            <br>
                            <br>Now, we translate TV programs into Farsi - 24 hours of content every day. We reach Iranians in their own language with the power of the name of Jesus. Amen!
                            <br>
                            <br> We continue our effort through prayer, establishing new churches underground in Iran, establishing new churches in Turkey, ministering locally in California, and continuing our TV outreach into Iran.</p>
